    journey: [
      `I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton, 
      where I'm developing a strong foundation in software engineering, AI/ML, and innovative problem-solving.
      I'm passionate about using technology to drive innovation and tackle complex challenges, and I'm always 
      eager to learn new skills to stay ahead in our ever-evolving digital world.`,
      
      `Every day I strive to grow, learning from my experiences and pushing myself to become a better version of
      who I was yesterday. I enjoy opportunities that allow me to work collaboratively, contribute to exciting 
      projects, and make a meaningful impact. I'm also known for my loyalty and commitment, always standing by my 
      team and my goals through every challenge.`,
      
      `When I'm not immersed in technology, you'll likely find me dancing, listening to music, attending concerts 
      and festivals, exploring new restaurants, and nature destinations :)`
